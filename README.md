# olavm-workshop

This tutorial explains the steps necessary to run the program on OlaVM, generate ZK(zero-knowledge) proof and verify.

# Prerequisites
There are some resources about OlaVM. The developers should learn the concepts and demonstrates to grasp the designs of OlaVM.

* [Ola - A ZKVM-based, High-performance, and Privacy-focused Layer2 platform](https://github.com/Sin7Y/olavm-whitepaper-v2/blob/master/Ola%20-%20A%20ZKVM-based%2C%20High-performance%2C%20and%20Privacy-focused%20Layer2%20platform.pdf)
* [Unveiling OlaVM Proof of Concept: The Next-Generation Full-Featured zkVM](https://medium.com/@sin7y/unveiling-olavm-proof-of-concept-the-next-generation-full-featured-zkvm-5840b27f8e4c)

# Table of Contents

* Edit the program: 
* Compile the program: 
* Run the program: refer to [olavm-execute.md](docs/olavm-execute.md).
* Generate ZK proof:
* Verify ZK proof:

Beginner Workshop: implement the fibonacci algorithm with loop and recursive two versions.

Advanced Workshop:  implement the sqrt algorithm with Newton method and prophet two versions.

Helpful Resources:
